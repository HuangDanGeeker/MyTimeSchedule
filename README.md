# MyTimeSchedule
personal time schedule

I'd like to create a QT project than would inform me to achieve some already arranged issues

At first, i'd like to install an App on my android. But without root privilege, no app can always run in background, whick will cause no failure.

But, i always stay with my pc, so with the power of QT, i'd like develop an TimeSchedule app which strats runing with the boot of system, always run in background, always works.

**QT Version** : **5.8.0**


because of lack of open sourse protocal, i'd allow and welcome any individual to use or reuse this project. If it would be used in commercial ways, inquiry is required.

anyway, donation will be deep appreciated!
